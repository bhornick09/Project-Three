# Project-Three

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This program was made for a hypothetical grocery store that analyzes records of purchased items, allows a user to interact with this data 
such as individual item frequency, overall item frequency, frequency displayed as a histogram, as well as an output data file creation. 
This project was used to help this hypothetical Grocery Store understand their sales and allow for easy interaction with their data.

* What did you do particularly well?
  In this project, I made a great user interface with input validation guiding the user to use the program correctly. I think I commented my code well and made for an overall good user experience.
  
* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  One major spot I feel as though I could have enhanced my code was in the search function. It would have been much better for the user if I would have added more matching capablities to the function such as, input not being case sensitive, and something like all matching inquiries for one letter. I could have made the search function be a lot more capable which would have enhanced the programs user experience and functionality.
  
* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The only challenging part of writing this code was learning the specifics of the Map. I haven't had any experience with these before so it took some research to understand how they work and how to pull data from them. Once I figured it out, the rest of the program came smoothly. I used the ZyBooks lesson on Maps and used the table of functions as well as some other research to figure the best ways possible to query from maps.
   
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects is most definitely the new map skills I've obtained as well as the search function I created in this program. The map is going to be something I can use very often to store volumes of data, and the search function will always be handy to have right along with the developed map.
  
* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable through things like specific commenting and arranging code in a way that makes the most sense. This code is easy to maintain as there are comments for every aspects function in the program meaning they'll be easy to find and adjust. The code is very readable due to its consistent indentations and structuring guiding the programmer through the code smoothly.
